#  Data exploration of global COVID-19 data

In this project, I conducted data exploratory analysis using SQL on COVID-19 data obtained between 2020-01-01 to 2023-12-07 by Our World in Data (downloaded from: ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). 

I adapted this project from Alex The Analyst (youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst) in which I investigated COVID cases, deaths and vaccinations by location (contry and continents). Additionally, I explored how income type affects case, death and vaccination totals. The skills I used include joins, CTE's, temp Tables, windows functions, aggregate functions, view creations and data type conversion. 

I used DB browser (SQLite) to conduct my analyses. The SQL queries can be found in the code folder, and the .csv data files in the data folder.
